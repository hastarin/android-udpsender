{"name":"Android-udpsender","tagline":"Simple application to allow sending UDP packets directly or via an Intent.ACTION_SENDTO with a udp://host:port/data format URI.","body":"android-udpsender\r\n=================\r\n\r\n[UDP Sender](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hastarin.android.udpsender) is a simple application to allow sending UDP packets.\r\n\r\n![Landscape Screenshot](https://raw.github.com/hastarin/android-udpsender/screenshots/screenshots/S4Landscape.png)\r\n\r\nIt supports the implicit [Intent](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html) <b>Intent.ACTION_SENDTO</b> with a <b>udp://host:port/data</b> format URI.  \r\n\r\n* data is treated as hex if it starts with 0x.  \r\n* If a string starting with 0x is to be sent it can be escaped as \\0x\r\n\r\n<b>Adeed in v1.3</b> - Current in Beta see http://goo.gl/reibxw to join\r\n* Added support for Tasker to do variable replacement for the host/port as well as the text.\r\n* Remembers your settings when you quit and re-launch the app.\r\n\r\n<b>Adeed in v1.2</b>\r\n* Now supports multi line text messages.\r\n* Bugfix for Send button not working in Landscape mode.\r\n\r\n<b>Adeed in v1.1</b> \r\n\r\n* Also acts as a plugin for Locale and Tasker.  \r\n* Variable replacement is supported for the Tasker plugin in the text field.\r\n* Changed theme to Holo (Dark)\r\n* Removed unused permissions\r\n* Various tweaks/fixes\r\n\r\n\r\nTasker Integration\r\n------------------\r\nTasker plugin support is now complete and should be straight forward to use.\r\n\r\n![Tasker Plugin](https://raw.github.com/hastarin/android-udpsender/screenshots/screenshots/TaskerPlugin.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternatively UDP packets can be sent via [Tasker](http://tasker.dinglisch.net/) with the Misc/Send Intent action.\r\n\r\nJust set it up as follows:\r\n* Action = android.intent.action.SENDTO\r\n* Data = udp://host:port/data\r\n* Target = Activity\r\n \r\n![Tasker Intent](https://raw.github.com/hastarin/android-udpsender/screenshots/screenshots/TaskerIntent.png)\r\n\r\nExample for a www.limitlessled.com Wi-Fi bridge at 192.168.1.100 to turn on all the white LEDs\r\n* Action = android.intent.action.SENDTO\r\n* Data = udp://192.168.1.100:50000/0x350055\r\n* Target = Activity\r\n\r\n\r\nTasker Example Project\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\n![Lights Scene](https://raw.github.com/hastarin/android-udpsender/screenshots/screenshots/TaskerLightsScene.png)\r\n\r\nYou can get a copy of my current Tasker project (or at least a portion of it) [Lights.prj.xml](https://raw.github.com/hastarin/android-udpsender/screenshots/screenshots/Lights.prj.xml) that I'm using for controlling my lights.\r\n\r\nTo give you an idea of how I'm using it I have the following:\r\n* Gesture control via my launcher (Nova) to turn all lights on/off/full bright/night mode and dim/brighten lights.\r\n* Using the Scene shown above I can turn all/individual zones on/off and control bright/dim/warm/cool.\r\n* NOTE: A swipe up/down in the colored square controls a bright/dim ramp and left/right for warm/cool.\r\n* An NFC tag on my bed that when tapped will turn the lights off, or keep some in night mode if I have guests.\r\n* When my phone connects to the Wi-Fi, and it's between sunrise and sunset, my entry hall light is turned on.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>NOTE:</b> *It should be obvious but you will need to edit this to use it*\r\n\r\n* Insert your own Weather Underground API key instead of &lt;YOURAPIKEYHERE&gt;.\r\n\r\nSee http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs for more info on getting one.\r\n\r\nIt's used by the \"Get Sunrise/set\" which is called once a day to update the global variables.  I use this in \"Check Night Time\" to only turn my entry light on at night when I arrive home and connect to my Wi-Fi.\r\n\r\n* You'll want to replace the string for my SSID with your own.  Search and replace C86241.  Or remove the Stop commands that prevent things working when not on the correct Wi-Fi.\r\n\r\n* You'll obviously need to change IPs and Names to suit your setup.\r\n\r\n* Finally if you're using a device that has a different size screen (my S4 is 1920x1080) you'll need to edit the scene so it fits and adjust the maths for the gestures.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-41052569-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
